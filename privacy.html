                    </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                      Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                      commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are

                      This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly.
                      However, the app may use third party code and libraries that
                      use “cookies” to collect information and improve their
                      services. You have the option to either accept or refuse

                      I want to inform users of this
                      Service that these third parties have access to your
                      Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
                      assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
                      not to disclose or use the information for any other
                      purpose.
                    </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                      I value your trust in providing us
                      your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
                      commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
                      that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
                      of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
                      I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

                      practices of any third-party sites or services.

                      I do not knowingly collect personally
                      identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                      I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                      me with personal information,
                      I immediately delete this from our servers. If you
